# GeneRankDetection

GeneRankDetection is a tool used for the early detection of breast cancer based on blood transcriptome, with the capability to integrate multiple batches of gene expression data across multiple platforms.

For a given expression file, it's supposed to have the first column as the gene name, and the first row as the sample name.
There are three steps for the prediction of samples in the expression file:
1. Transform the expression intensity value to relative expression information
1. Expression matrix transpose
1. Predict

We provided a packaged script for the prediction: 
```
rank_to_predict.sh
```

For example:

```
bash rank_to_predict.sh GSE11545.new
```
